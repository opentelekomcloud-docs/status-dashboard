User Guide for the Open Telekom Cloud Status Dashboard
======================================================

| Welcome to the Open Telekom Cloud Status Dashboard - Your go-to resource for monitoring the availability of various components across different regions.
| This guide is tailored for IT professionals to help navigate the platform and extract valuable insights from the Open Telekom Cloud.

Accessing the Status Website
----------------------------

Visit the Status Website at https://status.otc-service.com/.

Selecting Regions
-----------------

The platform supports multiple regions. Use the appropriate tab to select your desired region (e.g., **“EU-DE”** for Germany, **“EU-NL”** for the Netherlands, or **“GLOBAL”** for global services) to check service availability in that area.

Service Status
--------------

Services are grouped into categories such as **Compute**, **Network**, or **Storage**. Each service is accompanied by an icon (also known as a *semaphore*) indicating its current status:

-  |image1| **Green:** Service fully operational

-  |image2| **Yellow:** Minor Incident - Service is available but may have minor restrictions or reduced performance

-  |image3| **Red-orange:** Major Incident - Service is partially available but may cause noticeable impact or interruptions

-  |image4| **Red:** Service Outage - Service is unresponsive or facing serious issues

-  |image5| **Green with a dot:** Upcoming planned maintenance

-  |image6| **Blue wrench:** Ongoing maintenance

Auto-update / refresh of the dashboard
--------------------------------------

The dashboard automatically refreshes every minute. A green dot at the bottom of the page indicates that the update is functioning properly. |image7|

Incident / Maintenance Displays
-------------------------------

| Active **Incidents** or **Maintenances** are displayed above the main status area.
| Incidents are grouped by services affected at the same time, while maintenances are shown separately.

Current events appear as follows:

Access **“History”** via the top navigation bar to explore a comprehensive record of past incidents.

Component Availability
----------------------

| This feature provides insights into long-term service performance by region.

.. note::
   Service outages directly impact the availability metrics.


The Status Dashboard is designed to track and report the health and performance
of external Open Telekom Cloud APIs. It regularly checks configured endpoints,
collects timing and status data, and emits structured metrics to help teams
monitor API availability, latency, and reliability.


OTC App
-------

Another method is to use the `Open Telekom Cloud App <https://www.open-telekom-cloud.com/en/support/app>`__, which allows you to receive push notifications in case of status changes.

Tips for Effective Use
----------------------

-  **Bookmark** the status website for quick access during troubleshooting.

-  **Leverage incident history** to identify recurring issues and explore potential optimizations.

-  **Customize notifications** by region and service using the platform's alert settings.
